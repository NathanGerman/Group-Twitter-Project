# Group-Twitter-Project

My name is Nathan and me and my group made our first ever big twitter like project.

This code is a web app that works like a simplified version of Twitter. Users can register accounts, log in, follow or unfollow other users, and post short messages with optional images. All data is saved in a database, including users, posts, likes, and follows. The app shows a live feed where users can see posts, like them, and delete their own posts. It also includes basic security for passwords, posting limits to prevent spam, and custom styling to make the app visually appealing.
